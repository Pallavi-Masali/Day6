!.Title: Password Strength Evaluation
2.Objective: To understand strong password characteristics and evaluate their effectiveness.
3.Tool Used: Passwordmeter.com, Security.org Password Checker

Procedure:
1) Created passwords of varying complexity.
2) Tested each on online password strength tools.
3) Compared feedback and identified what factors improved strength.
4) Studied common password attacks and their prevention.

Findings:
1) Password strength increases with length, complexity, and unpredictability.
2) Passwords with personal names or patterns are weak even if symbols are added.
3) A strong password should resist brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Research â€” Common Password Attacks:
  Attack                                                   Type	Description
1.Brute Force Attack	                    Tries every possible combination â€” longer passwords take much longer to crack.
2.Dictionary Attack                     	Uses a list of common words â€” simple or common passwords are easily guessed.
3.Phishing Attack	                        Tricks users into revealing passwords.
4.Credential Stuffing                    	Uses stolen passwords from other sites â€” why you should never reuse passwords.  

Best Practices Learned:
ðŸ”¹ Minimum 12 characters
ðŸ”¹ Use mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
ðŸ”¹ Avoid real words or personal info
ðŸ”¹ Change passwords regularly
ðŸ”¹ Enable 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) for better security

Summarize how password complexity affects security:
Higher password complexity makes it harder for attackers to guess or crack passwords. Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and longer length greatly improves security and protects against brute-force and dictionary attacks.

Outcome:
âœ… Gained practical understanding of password strength testing.
âœ… Learned how password complexity affects resistance to attacks.
âœ… Developed awareness of best practices for creating and managing strong passwords.
